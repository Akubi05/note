# scDML train dataset with Triplet loss
If you want to merge dataset to expected number of cluster, you can call
```
embedding=scdml.train(expect_num_cluster=expect_num_cluster)
```

Otherwise if the number of cluster is unknown, you can call
```
embedding=scdml.train(expect_num_cluster=None)
```
in this case, scDML will apply a spetral clustering method to estimate the number of cluster in dataset
